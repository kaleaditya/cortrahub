## How It Works

### 1. Adding Trainers to Wishlist
1. Company user browses trainer directory
2. Clicks "Add to List" button on trainer cards
3. Trainer is added to company's wishlist via AJAX
4. Visual feedback confirms addition

### 2. Viewing Wishlist
1. Company user clicks "Go to List" in header
2. Redirects to program enquiry page
3. Shows all selected trainers in card layout
4. Options to remove trainers or send to admin

### 3. Sending to Admin
1. Company clicks "Send List to Admin" button
2. System groups trainers by category
3. Sends separate email for each category to admin
4. Email includes company details and trainer information

### 4. Program Enquiry with Details
1. Company fills program details form
2. Submits enquiry with selected trainers
3. System sends category-wise emails to admin with program details
4. Also sends emails to individual trainers

## Email Structure

### Admin Notification Email
- **Subject:** "Company Wishlist - [Category] Trainers Selected"
- **Content:**
  - Company details (name, contact, email, phone, website)
  - Category name and trainer count
  - Individual trainer details (name, email, phone, location, designation, qualification)
  - Program details (if submitting enquiry)
  - Action required section

### Category-wise Separation
- If company selects 3 Cross Level + 4 Top Management + 2 Entry Level trainers
- Admin receives 3 separate emails:
  1. "Company Wishlist - Cross Level Trainers Selected"
  2. "Company Wishlist - Top Management Trainers Selected"  
  3. "Company Wishlist - Entry Level Trainers Selected"

## Database Structure
Uses existing `company_trainer_list` pivot table:
- `company_id` - References companies table
- `trainer_id` - References users table
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

## Security Features

- Company authentication required for all wishlist operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and user feedback

## User Experience Features
- Loading states for all AJAX operations
- Success/error message display
- Button state management (disabled during operations)

2. **Adding trainers to wishlist**
3. **Removing trainers from wishlist**
4. **Sending wishlist to admin**
5. **Submitting program enquiry**
6. **Category-wise email sending**
7. **Mobile responsiveness**
